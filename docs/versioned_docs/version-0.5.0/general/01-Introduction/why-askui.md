# Why askui?
The askui library is a Typescript SDK and API which automates interactions with an application, multiple applications, or an entire operating system (OS) allowing you to quickly and easily write UI, e2e, and functional tests in the same environment or across environments concurrently.

## Who uses askui?
Typical users are developers and QA engineers building and testing web, native desktop, or mobile applications.
The askui library enables you to write all types of tests:
-   End-to-end tests
-   Integration tests
Test anything that runs on an OS or the OS itself, including both native and browser-based applications. Additionally, askui allows you to test interactions between multiple applications concurrently.
