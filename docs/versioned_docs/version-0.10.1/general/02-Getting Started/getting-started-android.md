## Access Token

As we need to prevent misuse of our API, we need you to create some credentials through our [askui user portal](https://app.askui.com/) (while still free) and [configure our library to use these credentials](../../api/Configuration/askui-ui-control-client#credentials) for authenticating and authorizing with our API.
