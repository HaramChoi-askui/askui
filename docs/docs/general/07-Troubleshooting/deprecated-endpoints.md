# Deprecated Endpoints

If you are using the askui library you may see this warning:

`This endpoint will be deprecated. Please upgrade your askui version.`

This means that you are using an old askui version and old endpoints of our API.
We will not maintain old endpoints and deprecate them in the near future. 

You can update askui to use our new endpoints with following command:

```shell
npm install askui@latest
```
