## Setup

* Follow the <a href="../Getting%20Started/getting-started" target="_blank">complete askui installation guide and write your first test</a>
* Create a folder named _askui_ on your desktop and put some files into it
* If you have multiple screens, configure the used display by setting the display variable at `test/helper/jest.setup.js`


## Test

After running the `npx askui init` command as described in the setup you will have a file `specs/my-first-askui-test-suite.spec.ts`. In this file add a new test inside the body of the callback passed to the `describe` function:

```ts
describe(/* a string identifying the test suite */, () => {
    ... (other tests)

    it('Should zip and then upload file to google drive', async () => {

    });
});
```

## Open the Folder askui



## Select All Images and Zip Them



## Navigate to Google Drive



## Search Zip-File and Upload


## Complete Code
