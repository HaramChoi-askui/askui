# Why askui?

The askui library provides you with an API that allows you to automate the interaction with an application, multiple applications or even an entire operating system (OS). You can use this to write ui, e2e or functional tests.

## Who uses askui?

Our typical users are developers or QA engineers building and testing web, native desktop or mobile applications.

The askui library enables you to write all types of tests:

- End-to-end tests
- Integration tests

With askui you can test anything that runs on an OS including both native and browser based applications. Additionally, you can open two applications next to each other to test their interaction.
