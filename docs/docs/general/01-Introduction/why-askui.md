# Why askui?
The askui library is a Typescript SDK that allows you to automate interactions with a device or even multiple devices. For example, 

- you could write an email inside your favorite note-taking app, then, 
- copy over the email to your email client running in your web browser to send it, and, then, 
- head over to your mobile phone to check that the email is inside the `Sent` folder of your email client's installation on your mobile phone 

completely automatically and inside one short script.

This way, you can write UI, e2e, and functional tests more powerfully than ever without caring about underlying technology or application contexts.

## Who uses askui?
Typical users are developers and QA engineers building and testing web, native desktop, or mobile applications.
The askui library enables you to write all types of tests:
-   End-to-end tests
-   Integration tests
Test anything that runs on an OS or the OS itself, including both native and browser-based applications. Additionally, askui allows you to test interactions between multiple applications.
