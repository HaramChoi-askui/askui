# Display

The file `specs/helpers/askui-helper.ts` helps to initialize the enviroment of all test suites.
As mentioned in the chapter [Writing Your First Test](../02-Getting%20Started/writing-your-first-test.md) you can choose on which display you want to excecute all
tests. You can only perform all tests on one display.
The apllication which you want to test should be open and selected on your chosen display.

The default value for display is `0` which is your main monitor. If you want to use your
second monitor you can change the value to `1` (`2` for yout third monitor etc.).

There is already an option if you the askui Application.
You can see the order of your monitors if you click on the askui logo and click on the menu show.
