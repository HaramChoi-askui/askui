# Why askui?

The askui library provides you with an API that allows you to automate the interaction with an application, multiple applications or even a whole operating system (OS). You can use this to write ui, e2e or functional tests. 

## Who uses askui?

Our users are typically developers or QA engineers building web applications, native desktop applications or mobile apps.

Askui enables you to write all types of tests:

- End-to-end tests
- Integration tests

Askui can test anything that runs on an OS including both native applications, native mobile apps and browser based apps. Additonally you can open two applications next to each to test their interaction.
